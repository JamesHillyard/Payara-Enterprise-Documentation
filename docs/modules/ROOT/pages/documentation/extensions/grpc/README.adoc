== What is gRPC?

The gRPC is a modern open-source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

* We can create services more efficient than REST.
* Use HTTP2 to provide full duplex communication between the client and the server.

The gRPC support provide the means for users to use the gRPC style service programming.

You can find the code for the gRPC implementation here: https://github.com/payara/gRPC.

You must restart the server if it was running to see your extension activated.
