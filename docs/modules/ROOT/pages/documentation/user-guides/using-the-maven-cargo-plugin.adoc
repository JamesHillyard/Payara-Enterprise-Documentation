= Using the Maven Cargo Plugin

When creating a Java EE application, it is important that development and
testing take place on a server that's as close to your target production
environment as possible.

By using the https://codehaus-cargo.github.io/cargo/Maven2+plugin.html[Maven Cargo
plugin] within your Maven project, it is possible to deploy your application to
local and remote instances of Payara Server Enterprise. The plugin makes use of the REST
management API in Payara Server.

== Adding the Cargo Plugin

The cargo plugin can be added to any Maven project by adding the following
to the `<build>` section of your pom:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.cargo</groupId>
            <artifactId>cargo-maven2-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.6.7</version>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
</build>
----

== Execution Goals

The Maven Cargo plugin comes with support for containers, where a container
represents a Java EE server. As Payara Server Enterprise is derived from GlassFish,
Payara Server is able to use the GlassFish container with the Maven Cargo
Plugin.

There are a number of common goals:

 - `start`:
 ** Runs the `start` goal, starting a _local_ server in the background and
 deploying any applications before proceeding to the next step. If a container
 is already started, by default `start` will only stop the pre-existing
 container.

 - `run`:
 ** Runs the `run` goal, starting a _local_ server in the foreground until
 cancelled.

 - `redeploy`:
 ** Runs the `redeploy` goal, deploying the built application. This will
 automatically undeploy the application and redeploy if needed.

 - `undeploy`:
 ** Runs the `undeploy` goal, undeploying the application.

 - `stop`:
 ** Runs the `stop` goal, stopping the _local_ server. This does not work for
 remote servers.

=== Deploying via the Cargo Plugin

To deploy your application to Payara Server Enterprise using the Maven Cargo Plugin, the
plugin needs to be configured. Since there is a good chance that both local and
remote Payara Servers may need to be used, the best way to manage these multiple
configurations is to add a _profile_. From a general perspective, a Maven profile
serves to collate specific configuration under a single command line flag.

Within a Maven profile you can specify configuration for Payara Server within
the Cargo plugin: the host, port, username, password, and importantly whether
to use an existing or new local or remote server.

The example snippet below is taken from a profile which defines deployment to a
local Payara Server instance.

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.cargo</groupId>
  <artifactId>cargo-maven2-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <container>
      <containerId>glassfish4x</containerId>
      <type>installed</type>
      <home>${payara.home}</home>
    </container>
    <configuration>
      <type>existing</type>
      <home>${payara.domainDir}</home>
      <properties>
        <cargo.glassfish.domain.name>${payara.domainName}</cargo.glassfish.domain.name>
      </properties>
    </configuration>
  </configuration>
  <!-- provides JSR88 client API to deploy on Payara -->
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.glassfish.main.deployment</groupId>
      <artifactId>deployment-client</artifactId>
      <version>4.1.1</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</plugin>
----

Note that the above example uses properties to reference the Payara Server
configuration.  To achieve the same thing, you will need to specify properties
that refer to your own environment similar to the following example:

[source, xml]
----
    <properties>
        ...
 
        <payara.adminPort>4848</payara.adminPort>
        <payara.username>admin</payara.username>
        <payara.password></payara.password>
        <payara.hostname>localhost</payara.hostname>
        <payara.domainName>domain1</payara.domainName>
        <payara.home></payara.home>
        <payara.domainDir>${payara.home}/glassfish/domains</payara.domainDir>
 
    </properties>
----

To deploy to a remote instance of Payara Server Enterprise, we need to make sure to add
a username and password for the remote instance, as well as an admin port and
hostname. Remote hosts cannot `start` or `stop`; the server must already be
running.

To create a profile for a remote Payara Server instance, add the following
to a Maven profile in your pom:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.cargo</groupId>
  <artifactId>cargo-maven2-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <container>
      <containerId>glassfish4x</containerId>
      <type>remote</type>
    </container>
    <configuration>
      <type>runtime</type>
      <properties>
        <cargo.remote.username>${payara.username}</cargo.remote.username>
        <cargo.remote.password>${payara.password}</cargo.remote.password>
        <cargo.glassfish.admin.port>${payara.adminPort}</cargo.glassfish.admin.port>
        <cargo.hostname>${payara.hostname}</cargo.hostname>
      </properties>
    </configuration>
  </configuration>
  <!-- provides JSR88 client API to deploy on Payara Server -->
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.glassfish.main.deployment</groupId>
      <artifactId>deployment-client</artifactId>
      <version>4.1.1</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</plugin>

A complete example can be found in https://github.com/payara/Payara-Examples/blob/master/ecosystem/payara-maven/pom.xml[
the Payara Examples repository.] The example demonstrates the same remote and 
local deployment methods in two separate profiles.
