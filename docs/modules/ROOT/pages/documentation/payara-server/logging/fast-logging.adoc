= Fast Logging

By default, a toString() is forced on all parameters within the same thread as the application. This stops a mutable object being changed after the log statement is issued and thus wrong values be written out in the log entry, but can cause a performance impact with JPA entities as it may result in database access.

With `Fast Logging` enabled, this forced toString() is skipped.

WARNING: This can cause log messages with mutable parameters to be out of sync and contain changed values when the log is written.

You can disable the forced toString() by enabling the `Fast Logging` option via the admin console or asadmin command.
