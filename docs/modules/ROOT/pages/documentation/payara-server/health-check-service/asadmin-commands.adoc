= HealthCheck Service Asadmin Command Reference

The following is a detailed list of the administration commands that can be used
to correctly configure the HealthCheck Service.

[[set-healthcheck-configuration]]
== `set-healthcheck-configuration`

*Usage*::
----
set-healthcheck-configuration
 --enabled=true|false
 --dynamic=true|false
 --historic-trace-enabled=true|false
 --historic-trace-store-size=20
 --historic-trace-store-timeout=<integer.value>s|m|h|d
----

*Aim*::
Enables and disables the HealthCheck service. This includes configuration for tracing historic health check events for later inspection.

|Option
|Type
|Description
|Default
|Mandatory

|`--target`
|String
|The instance or cluster that will enable or disable its service
|server
|no

|`--dynamic`
|Boolean
|Whether to apply the changes directly to the server without a restart
|false
|no

|`--enabled`
|Boolean
|Whether to enable or disable the service
|N/A
|yes

|`--historic-trace-enabled`
|Boolean
|Enables storing traces in a rolling store for later inspection
|false |no

|`--historic-trace-store-size`
|Integer
|Sets the maximum number of health checks to store
|20
|no

|`--historic-trace-store-timeout`
|String
|Sets the time period after which a historic health check event entry is removed from visable history. The time expression should consist of a number followed by a time unit; `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours or `d` for days. If no time unit is given the number specifies seconds. If the parameter is zero or unspecified there is no timeout for entries.
|-
|no

|===

NOTE: Enabling or disabling the health check service implicitly also enables or disables the log notifier which is the default notifier. This behaviour is similar to the replaced <<healthcheck-configure>> command.

[[example-8]]
=== Example

The following example will enable the Healthcheck service such that it will
only activate from the next time the server is restarted. It enables the log
notifier and sets the historical trace store to retain 20 health checks.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-configuration
    --enabled=true
    --dynamic=false
    --historic-trace-enabled=true
    --historic-trace-store-size=20
----

[[healthcheck-configure]]
== `healthcheck-configure`

NOTE: This is deprecated in 5.191 and will be removed in the future as it is replaced with the <<set-healthcheck-configuration>> command.

*Usage*::
`asadmin> healthcheck-configure --enabled=true|false --dynamic=true|false --historicaltraceenabled --historicaltracestoresize=20`

*Aim*::
Enables and disables the HealthCheck service. Also allows configuration of the store of historical health checks.

[[example-10]]
=== Examples
A very basic example command to simply enable the GC checker and activate it without
needing a restart would be as follows:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --enabled=true
 --service=gc
 --dynamic=true
----

[[example-11]]
Monitoring the health of JDBC connection pools is a common need. In that
scenario, it is very unlikely that on-the-fly configuration changes
would be made, so a very high `CRITICAL` threshold can be set. Likewise,
a nonzero `GOOD` threshold is needed because an empty or unused
connection pool may not be healthy either.

The following command would apply these settings to the connection pool
checker:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --service=cp
 --dynamic=true
 --threshold-critical=95
 --threshold-warning=70
 --threshold-good=30
----

[[example-12]]
Monitoring which threads hog the CPU is extremely important since this can lead
to performance degradation, deadlocks and extreme bottlenecks issues that web
applications can incur. In some cases the defaults are all that is needed, but imagine
that in a critical system you want to set the threshold percentage to **90%**,
and you want to make sure that the health check service guarantees the state of such
threads with a retry count of *5*. Additionally, you want to set the frequency of
this check for every _20 seconds_.

The following command would apply these settings to the connection pool checker:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --service=cp
 --dynamic=true
 --hogging-threads-threshold=90
 --hogging-threads-retry-count=5
 --time=20
 --time-unit=SECONDS
----

[[example-13]]
The following example configures the stuck threads checker to check every 30
seconds for any threads which have been stuck for more than 5 minutes and
applies the configuration change without needing a restart:

[source, Shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --service=stuck-thread
 --enabled=true
 --dynamic=true
 --time=30
 --time-unit=SECONDS
 --stuck-threads-threshold=5
 --stuck-threads-threshold-unit=MINUTES
----


[[healthcheck-configure-service]]
== `healthcheck-configure-service`

NOTE: This is deprecated in 5.191 and will be removed in the future as it is replaced with the <<set-healthcheck-service-configuration>> command.

*Usage*::
`asadmin> healthcheck-configure-service --serviceName=<service.name>
--checkerName=<name> --enabled=true|false --dynamic=true|false
--time=<integer.value> --unit=MICROSECONDS|MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS`

*Aim*::
Enables or disables the monitoring of an specific checker. The command
also configures the frequency of monitoring for that metric.

command, it will succeed and the configuration will be saved, but the HealthCheck
service will not be enabled.

[[example-2]]
=== Example
A very basic example command to simply enable the GC checker and activate it without
needing a restart would be as follows:

[source, shell]

*Aim*::
Configures `CRITICAL`, `WARNING` and `GOOD` threshold range values for a
service checker. The `dynamic` attribute should be set to `true` in order to apply
the changes directly.

[[healthcheck-hoggingthreads-configure]]
== `healthcheck-hoggingthreads-configure`

NOTE: This is deprecated in 5.191 and will be removed in the future as it is replaced with the <<set-healthcheck-service-configuration>> command.

*Usage*::
`asadmin> healthcheck-hoggingthreads-configure --dynamic=true|false --threshold-percentage=50 --retry-count=3`

*Aim*::
Configures the *Hogging Threads* checker service settings. The checker
will determine which running threads are hogging the CPU by calculating a percentage
of usage with the ratio of elapsed time to the checker service execution interval and
verifying if this percentage exceeds the `threshold-percentage`.
+
You can also use this command to  enable the checker and configure the monitoring
frequency as you would do with the `healthcheck-configure-service` command.
