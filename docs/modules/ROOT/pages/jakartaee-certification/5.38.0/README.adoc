= Jakarta EE Platform 8 Certification Summaries

Payara Server is certified https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE] implementation.
As proof of compatibility, output of Jakarta EE Compatibility Test Suite tests are presented for each certified version.

There is a flaw in the TCK Runner related to versions containing "8." which causes the JACC test suites to fail falsely. Running the Payara Enterprise 5.38.0 artifact with the version numbers changed to "5.38.0-SNAPSHOT" through the Jakarta TCK causes the JACC suite to pass. This has no impact on the functionality of Payara Enterprise 5.38.0.

The following distributions of Payara 5.38.0 are certified:

* xref:jakartaee-certification/5.38.0/tck-results-full-5.38.0.adoc[Payara Server 5.38.0 - Full profile]
