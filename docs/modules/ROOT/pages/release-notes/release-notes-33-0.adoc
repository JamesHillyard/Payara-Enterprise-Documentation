# Release Notes - Payara Platform Enterprise 5.33.0

### Supported APIs and Applications
* Jakarta EE 8
* Java EE 8 Applications
* MicroProfile 4.1


#### Breaking Changes

##### TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 Disabled within Docker

The JDK version within the Docker images is upgraded to 8u312 and 11.0.13 respectively.  These versions have the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocol disabled by default as they are considered insecure nowadays. This will only affect if your application creates sockets and defines the TLS version explicitly. There is no problem when calling a remote endpoint using https unless that remote service does not support version 1.2 or higher of the TLS protocol.
