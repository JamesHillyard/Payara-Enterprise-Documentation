== Supported APIs and Applications

* Java EE 8 Applications
* MicroProfile 3.3
* Jakarta EE 8 Applications

*Notes*

In Payara Enterprise 5.21.0 (released in July), we added HTTP/2 support for JDK Native ALPN APIs. Unfortunately, we determined it has the potential for becoming unstable in certain situations. To maintain security and stability for all Enterprise customers in any situation - we've removed it from our Enterprise Editions until it's matured further. Reverting HTTP/2 support to how it worked in Payara Enterprise 5.20.0  means it will currently not work when using JDK 8u252 or higher (including JDK 11).

You may continue using HTTP/2 with an older supported version of JDK 8 (8u162-8u242). We will re-add HTTP/2 support for JDK Native ALPN APIs to Payara Enterprise in a future release after itâ€™s deemed stable.
